# Style Guide

## Colour Guide

To change the colours used within the website, all values which are in this
document must be prefixed by "--greenova" while if they exist in picocss must
be overwritten. When adding a colour, make it clear that it is written for
greenova, under the correct category and list the use cases. When changing a
colour of an existing element / pico variable please list the use case, using
as little custom classes as possible.

## HTMX Indicator Requirements

### Persistent Indicator Element

- The `#htmx-indicator` element is provided by `base.html` and must remain outside any htmx swap targets.
- Do **not** include or remove `#htmx-indicator` in any content that may be swapped by htmx.
- All `hx-indicator` attributes must reference an element that is always present in the DOM.
- If you add new htmx-enhanced forms or components, ensure the indicator is not inside a swap target.

#### Example

```html
<!-- Correct: indicator outside swap target -->
<div id="htmx-indicator"></div>
<div id="main-content" hx-target="this">
  <!-- Swapped content here -->
</div>

<!-- Incorrect: indicator inside swap target -->
<div id="main-content" hx-target="this">
  <div id="htmx-indicator"></div>
  <!-- This will be removed on swap! -->
</div>
```

See also: `docs/resources/js/htmx.md` and `base.html` for implementation details.
