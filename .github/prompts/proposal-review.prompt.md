 Hello Simon F.  Greenova is an inspiring and impactful project, and Iâ€™d love to help elevate it from proof-of-concept to production-ready. With over 7 years of Django experience, I specialize in building clean, well-tested, and accessible web applications, prioritizing maintainability and strong documentation. Iâ€™ve contributed to several open-source Django projects ensuring modular architecture, strict typing, and comprehensive test coverageâ€”all in line with best practices.  Hereâ€™s how Iâ€™d approach Greenova:  1. Deep dive into the existing codebase; run tests and CI locally. 2. Integrate django-allauth with MFA and refactor templates using PicoCSS ensuring WCAG 2.1 AA compliance. 3. Systematically implement and type-annotate each module (Projects, Obligations, Assignments, etc.), covering validation and accessible forms. 4. Enhance dashboards with filtering, drill-down, and interactive visualizations via Plotly and matplotlib, serializing data with protobuf3. 5. Expand testing throughout with pytest plugins aiming for >80% coverage, adding type stubs and strict mypy checking. 6. Refactor codebase for readability, maintainability, and documentation completeness.  I propose a smooth onboarding with a walkthrough session, followed by incremental pull requests for continuous review. Iâ€™m available to start immediately and can meet your 6 June deadline with focused effort.  Looking forward to collaborating and making Greenova a success!  Warm regards,  Aleksandar Popovic
