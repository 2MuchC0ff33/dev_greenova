I'm excited about the Greenova project! Can you share more about your current priorities and any specific challenges you're facing?

 Hello Awais,  Thank you for your interest and enthusiasm for Greenova!  CURRENT PRIORITIES  1. Solidifying the core platform: Ensuring the main models, user flows, and CRUD interfaces for obligations, projects, mechanisms, procedures, responisbilty and user/company profiles are robust and accessible. 2. Refactoring for production-readiness: Adding strict type annotations, docstrings, and beartype decorators across the codebase, and ensuring all modules follow our documentation and style standards. 3. Improving test coverage: Expanding and refining tests to achieve at least 80% overall coverage (100% for critical modules), and ensuring all CI checks pass reliably. 4. Enhancing the user experience: Refactoring the dashboard for better filtering, drill-down navigation, overdue obligation tooltips, and integrating accessible grid layout charts (matplotlib and Plotly- Python SDK). 5. Integrating authentication: Completing MFA integration with django-allauth, and making sure templates are accessible and styled with the classless PicoCSS framework. 6. Documentation: Keeping all guides, API docs, and architecture documents up-to-date as the platform evolves.  CURRENT CHALLENGES  - Ensuring accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA) across all templates and UI flows, particularly with dynamic components (HTMX, hyperscript). - Balancing modularity and maintainability as new features are added, especially around permissions, linking all model relationships back to obligations and responsibility assignments. - Keeping type safety and documentation consistent as the codebase grows and contributors join. - Managing test coverage and linting requirements as features are refactored or expanded. - Deciding the best workflow for maintaining protobuf3 schemas (manual vs. auto-generation) and preparing for future integrations with external systems.  We’re looking for contributors who can help address these priorities, suggest improvements, and work collaboratively to bring Greenova to production-quality.  If you have experience in any of these areas or ideas for tackling the challenges, I’d love to hear more!  Best regards,  Adrian Gallo Greenova Maintainer

 Hi, few questions on scope
11:50 PM
 Can you confirm if you want protobuf3 schemas to be maintained manually or auto-generated?  Do you already have designs or wireframes for the updated dashboard, tooltips, or charts?  For django-allauth MFA, do you have a preferred method (e.g. TOTP, WebAuthn, SMS)?  Do you want to keep SQLite for production or plan to move to PostgreSQL or another DB later?  Are there any models or modules you consider critical and require 100% test coverage?  Do you have pre-configured CI and pre-commit hooks set up in the repo already?  How strict are the type checks currently with mypy — should they block CI if failed?  Is there a preferred structure or location where protobuf3 schemas should be stored?  Do you already use any mock/stub strategy in tests, or should we set one up?

**Greenova: Django Platform for Environmental Compliance**  Greenova is an open-source Django platform designed for environmental professionals to track, manage, and report on compliance obligations. The project is modular, extensible, and currently at the proof-of-concept stage. We are seeking a Django development firm or experienced freelancers to help bring it to production readiness.  ---  **Project Goals**  - Deliver a robust, maintainable proof-of-concept for stakeholders. - Ensure high code quality, documentation, and test coverage. - Implement features outlined in the roadmap and open issues.  ---  **Tech Stack**  - Backend: Python 3.12.9, Django 5.2  - Frontend: Semantic HTML5, PicoCSS (classless), django-hyperscript, django-htmx  - Database: SQLite3 (dev/prod)  - Other: Protobuf3, SASS/PostCSS, TypeScript/AssemblyScript (optional)  - Testing: pytest, pytest-django, pytest-cov, pytest-xdist  - Linting: ruff, pylint, djlint, markdownlint, stylelint, eslint, shellcheck, ruff-format, isort, prettier, shfmt  - Type Checking: mypy (strict), beartype, stubgen, stubtest  ---  **Current Status**  - Modular Django project (see GitHub codebase)  - Core models, views, and forms for obligation tracking  - Initial APIs and admin interface  - Comprehensive documentation  - Active issues and pull requests  ---  **Scope of Work (Summary)**  1. Authentication: Integrate django-allauth with MFA, refactor templates for accessibility and PicoCSS, add runtime type checking, docstrings, and tests.  2. Projects & Mechanisms: User-facing CRUD, enforce relationships, strict type annotations, accessible forms.  3. Obligations: User-facing CRUD, validation, accessible forms, type annotations.  4. Responsibility Assignment: Add assignment UI, enforce permissions, type/refactor.  5. Compliance Status: Refactor dashboard, add filtering and drill-down, improve accessibility.  6. User & Company Profiles: User-facing CRUD, enforce permissions, type/refactor.  7. Drill-down Navigation: Implement user-facing drill-down (mechanism → procedure → obligation), filtering/sorting, accessible CRUD.  8. Overdue Obligations Tooltip: Add interactive, accessible tooltip for overdue obligations in dashboard.  9. Charts & Visualizations: Integrate matplotlib (static) and Plotly (interactive) for dashboards/reports; ensure accessibility; serialize data via protobuf3.  10. Protobuf3 Schemas: Implement and maintain protobuf3 for backend/external data serialization.  11. Code Review & Refactor: Ensure maintainability, readability, and standards compliance.  ---  **General Tasks**  - Refactor for type annotations, docstrings, and beartype decorators.  - Use semantic HTML and PicoCSS; ensure accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA).  - Add and expand tests for all user flows.  - Document all modules and workflows per project standards.  ---  **Deliverables**  - Refactored, documented Django codebase  - Passing CI and pre-commit checks  - 80%+ test coverage (100% for critical modules)  - Validated type stubs (.pyi, py.typed)  - Updated documentation  - Summary report of changes and recommendations  ---  **Timeline & Process**  - Start: ASAP (Kick-off Monday, 26 May 2025)  - Due: 6 June 2025  - Applications will be reviewed for technical fit, code quality, and communication.  - Shortlisted candidates may complete a small code review/test task.  - Final selection based on merit and alignment with project goals.  ---  **To Apply**  Please include:  - A brief summary of your Django experience and approach to code quality  - References to similar projects or contributions (links preferred)  - Your proposed onboarding/review plan  - Availability and timeline for the initial phase  ---  **Resources**  - README  - CONTRIBUTING  - API Documentation  - Architecture Overview  - Testing Guide  - Roadmap  - Style Guide  - FAQ  - GitHub Issues and Pull Requests  (All available at: github.com/enveng-group/dev_greenova)  ---  **Additional Info**  - License: AGPL-3.0  - All work must comply with documentation, style, and accessibility requirements.  - For questions, please review the FAQ or open a GitHub issue.
