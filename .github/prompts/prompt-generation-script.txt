using prompt-generation.prompt.md for instructions and formatting, please overwrite and generate a new prompt in gpt-4-1.prompt.md to resolve the below issue:


i have added the following files in the landing app that may assist with solving the logic probnlem: commons.py constants.py context_processors.py middleware.py mixins.py permissions.py serializers.py signals.py tasks.py validators.py and templatetags/landing_tags.py


this prompt gpt-4.1.prompt.md has a lot of tasks for agent to do, therefore, still maintaining the strict layout of the prompt template using prompt-generation.prompt.md as guidance, would it be possible to break down this macro prompt into smaller micro prompts so i can pass to copilot agent sequentially after the previous step and aceeptance criteria is completed and implemented, please generate all the micro templates one by one in sequential order i need to run in the file batch-prompts.prompt.md.
